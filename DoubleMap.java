/**
 * DoubleMap.java
 * 
 * This class enables forming a collection of graphs that are indexed by double valued keys.
 * These keys are actually values of the invariant for which we are interested to find 
 * extremal graphs or pairs of graphs with (approximately) the same value of the invariant.
 * This class relies on DoubleUtil class to properly handle the keys that are approximately equal.
 * 
 * Since different graphs often come up with the same key(=invariant) values,
 * entries of the large collection are actually pairs of a key and an additional collection
 * that carries all graphs with that given key value.
 * 
 * Since this map will be used to keep all graphs from a file within memory,
 * values kept in the map are g6codes only (String) and not Graph objects.
 * Reasoning is that g6codes take only a fraction of the memory compared to Graph objects,
 * and Graph object can easily be reconstructed from its g6code.
